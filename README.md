## Project Details

### Data Preparation
The notebook starts with loading and preprocessing the image dataset. This includes resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### Model Building
The model architecture is defined using [specify framework, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras].
The model is set up with appropriate parameters and configurations for image classification tasks.

### Model Training
This section outlines the process of training the model. Key steps include setting training parameters, choosing an optimizer, and defining the loss function. Training progress is monitored using accuracy and loss metrics.

### Evaluation and Fine-Tuning
After initial training, the model is evaluated on a validation set. The notebook includes steps for fine-tuning the model to improve its accuracy and prevent overfitting. Techniques like  dropout, regularization are employed.

## Results
The final section of the notebook presents the results of the model evaluation. This includes performance metrics like accuracy and loss on the test dataset. The notebook also contains visualizations such as plots showing training/validation accuracy and loss over epochs.
